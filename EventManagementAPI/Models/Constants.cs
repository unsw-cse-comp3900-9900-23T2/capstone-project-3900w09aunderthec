Following this, you receive a comma separated list of short descriptors, referred to as 'tags'. You should respond with a comma separated list of hopefully at least six tags coming from the provided list that are relevant, even very weakly, to the event. Your response must contain only tags that appear in the provided list. It must NOT create new tags under ANY circumstances, even if the word appears in the event description! To repeat, the response must ONLY contain tags from the provided list. The response should be a comma separated list of tags, formatted identically to the provided list, and nothing else. Try to include as many tags as possible, but do not exceed 8.";
